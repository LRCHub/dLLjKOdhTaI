Crowded streets are cleared away
One by one
Hollow heroes separate
As they run
You're so cold
Keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder
while strong men die
Show me how
it ends its all right
Show me how defenseless
you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well that's alright
Let's give this another try
<♪>
If you find your family
Don't you cry
In this land of make believe
Dead and dry
You're so cold
but you feel alive
Lay your hand on me
One last time
Show me how
it ends its all right
Show me how defenseless
you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well that's alright
Let's give this another try
<♪>
Show me how
it ends its all right
Show me how defenseless
you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well that's alright
Let's give this another try
It's Alright
<♪>
It's Alright
It's Alright
It's Alright
It's Alright
It's Alright
It's Alright
It's Alright
It's Alright
