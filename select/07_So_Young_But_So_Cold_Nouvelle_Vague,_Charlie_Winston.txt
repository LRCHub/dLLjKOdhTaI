You're just someone so young but so cold
And none of this is in your control
Bad boys is what you're in for
And now you just start to be lonely

And one is that you want to be free
And nothing is that you want to be
Well do so, I'm glad you've done something right
But I've heard this song before and I say:

Oh, so young but so cold
Oh-oh, so young but so old

You spend your lonely nights
With any boy who gives you money
You say: "It's done I don't care"
But the change is only your body
And there I go coming in and out and it's just too much now
And the lights are chinking in and out
O-oh, I've heard it's gonna mend. Say:

Oh, so young but so cold
Oh-oh, so young but so old
Oh, so young but so cold
Oh-oh, so young but so old

That's amazing that you wanna be like
Here's a Queen and you're all I want to do right
And I know just what it's gonna be like
'Cause you won't believe in yourself

You can tell them anything
But who says that they'll listen
Another lie is just the same
And I won't take it any more

Oh, so young but so cold
Oh-oh, so young but so old
Oh, so young but so cold
Oh-oh, so young but so cold, so young but so cold...
