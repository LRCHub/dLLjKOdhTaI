[00:59.52]

[00:55.13] I think her engine is permanently stalled
[00:58.52] She's so cold she's so cold
[01:01.67] She's so cold cold cold
[01:03.49] Like a tombstone
[01:05.50] She's so cold, she's so cold

[02:59.38] Who would believe you were a beauty indeed
[03:02.43] When the days get shorter and the nights get long
[03:05.96] Night fades when the rain comes
[03:09.95] Nobody will know, when you're old
[03:14.49] When you're old, nobody will know
[03:30.99] 
[03:19.52] That you was a beauty, a sweet sweet beauty
[03:23.06] A sweet sweet beauty, but stone stone cold
[03:26.67] You're so cold, you're so cold, cold, cold
